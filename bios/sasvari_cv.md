Since √Ågoston gained a PhD in Structural Geology, he is working in and for the oil industry either as consultant or as staff member of medium size operators. After trying Turbo Pascal and C++, he got 'infected' with Python and since that, he is developing his own tools for (not only the) oil industry - from fault seal analysis and borehole break-out inversion tools to large scale digital projects. Digital footprints at [SG2PS](http://www.sg2ps.eu) and [Kadath](http://www.kadath.hu).
